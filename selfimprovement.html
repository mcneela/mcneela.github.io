<h1>My Goals</h1>
<p>I use this page to categorize and collect my current list of self-improvement goals. I also use it to track 
my progress towards achieving them. Many of these goals will be fitness, entrepreneurship, or lifestyle related.
More personal goals will be left off here for the time being, although maybe I will add them in the future!
</p>
<p>For goals which I have achieved, I'll put a line through them with the date and possibly link to a blog post 
	containing more details. The process of recording these on my blog is partially inspired by 
	<a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">this blog post</a> which I recently had the pleasure of
	reading. It's also so that I can hold myself more publicly and personably accountable for achieving what
	I've set out to achieve. I'll periodically add to and update this list as needed.
</p>
