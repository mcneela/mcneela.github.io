  <h4>Natural Language Generative Models for Program Synthesis</h4>
  <h5>Under Development</h5>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Description:</b> I am working with fellow students in the EECS department
  on training LSTMs and other deep models to generate working Python code from natural
  language descriptions of programming tasks. This is a class project for CS 294-131:
  Special Topics in Deep Learning and is under active development.</li>
  <li><b>Relevant Technologies/Skills:</b> Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras, Deep Learning
  </li></ul>
  <h4>Retina - Google Summer of Code</h4>

  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Description:</b> I participated in Google Summer of Code
  from June - August 2016, and built out a suite of scientific
  visualization tools called <b>Fovea</b>. The new project is called
  <b>Retina</b> and is hosted on my Github. If you're interested in
  creating dynamic, interactive visualizations using Matplotlib or Plotly then check it out! For those interested, you can view my
  accepted project proposal <a href="proposal.pdf">here</a>.</li>
