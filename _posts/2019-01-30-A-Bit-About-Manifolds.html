<h1>A Bit About Manifolds</h1>
A <i>manifold</i>, in the broadest sense, is a structure which is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$
at each of its open sets. In layman's terms, this means that while a manifold may be sufficiently "abstracted"
such that its elements look nothing like those of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can regardless treat the manifold as if
it's $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a few potential caveats. But first, the formal definition.
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition 1</b></u> A <i>manifold</i> is a second countable Hausdorff space $M$ equipped with a collection of
"charts" such that for each open $U \subset M$ there exists a homeomorphism $\phi: U \to V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$
where $V$ is itself open. This $\phi$ is called a chart. We require that each $x \in M$ be in the domain of some
chart. We require that the collection of charts be maximal subject to the conditions above.
</br></br>
If we want to be able to perform calculus on our manifolds, however, a bit more is required.
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition 2</b></u> A <i>smooth</i> ($C^\infty$) manifold is a manifold with the additional
restriction that the change of coordinates defined by the composition of one chart and another's inverse is itself
$C^\infty$. That is, we require for two charts $\phi$ and $\psi$ that given $\phi: U \to U' \subset \mathbb{R}^n, \psi: V \to V' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, the following be continuously differentiable of all orders

$$\phi \psi^{-1} : \psi (U \cap V) \to \phi (U \cap V)$$

Both of these definitions look like quite the mouthful at first, but there's really little in the way of hidden complexity.
The defacto differentiability requirements on the change of coordinates mappings make inherent sense. If this differentiability
was not presupposed, there'd be nothing restricting the manifold from being put together as a patchwork of locally smooth
neighborhoods that don't inherently connect in a "nice" way, i.e. there may exist discontinuities at the points where they join.
</br></br>
The notion of second countability may throw some for a loop, so I'll take some time to review it. A topological space is called
second countable if it exhibits a countable base $\mathcal{B} = \cup_{i=1}^\infty B_i$. This is a property that's characteristic
of many conventionally "nice" mathematical spaces, and its presence in this definition is a natural consequence of the homeomorphicity
with $\mathbb{R}^n$. $\mathbb{R}^n$ is second countable, and second countability is a topological invariant. More concretely,
since there exists a countable collection of open sets $\mathcal{B}$ which form a base for $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can take this collection and form
its equivalent in $M$ by applying the appropriate inverse chart $U_i = \phi_i^{-1}(B_i)$ for $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ to get a countable
base $\mathcal{U} = \cup_{i=1}^\infty$ for $M$.
