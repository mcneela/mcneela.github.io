<h1>A Bit About Manifolds</h1>
A <i>manifold</i>, in the broadest sense, is a structure which is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$
at each of its open sets. In layman's terms, this means that while a manifold may be sufficiently "abstracted"
such that its elements look nothing like those of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can regardless treat the manifold as if
it's $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a few potential caveats. But first, the formal definition.
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition 1</b></u> A <i>manifold</i> is a second countable Hausdorff space $M$ equipped with a collection of
"charts" (called an atlas) such that for each open $U \subset M$ there exists a homeomorphism $\phi: U \to V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$
where $V$ is itself open. This $\phi$ is called a chart. We require that each $x \in M$ be in the domain of some
chart. We require that the collection of charts be maximal subject to the conditions above.
</br></br>
If we want to be able to perform calculus on our manifolds, however, a bit more is required.
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition 2</b></u> A <i>smooth</i> ($C^\infty$) manifold is a manifold with the additional
restriction that the change of coordinates defined by the composition of one chart and another's inverse is itself
$C^\infty$. That is, we require for two charts $\phi$ and $\psi$ that given $\phi: U \to U' \subset \mathbb{R}^n, \psi: V \to V' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, the following be continuously differentiable of all orders

$$\phi \psi^{-1} : \psi (U \cap V) \to \phi (U \cap V)$$

Both of these definitions look like quite the mouthful at first, but there's really little in the way of hidden complexity.
The defacto differentiability requirements on the change of coordinates mappings make inherent sense. If this differentiability
was not presupposed, there'd be nothing restricting the manifold from being put together as a patchwork of locally smooth
neighborhoods that don't inherently connect in a "nice" way, i.e. there may exist discontinuities at the points where they join.
</br></br>
The notion of second countability may throw some for a loop, so I'll take some time to review it. A topological space is called
second countable if it exhibits a countable base $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i$. This is a property that's characteristic
of many conventionally "nice" mathematical spaces, and its presence in this definition is a natural consequence of the homeomorphicity
with $\mathbb{R}^n$. $\mathbb{R}^n$ is second countable, and second countability is a topological invariant. More concretely,
since there exists a countable collection of open sets $\mathcal{B}$ which form a base for $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can take this collection and form
its equivalent in $M$ by applying the appropriate inverse chart $U_i = \phi_i^{-1}(B_i)$ for $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ to get a countable
base $\mathcal{U} = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i$ for $M$.
</br></br>
Similarly, when we look at the Hausdorff condition in the manifold definition, it follows naturally from the homeomorphic nature of
the neighborhoods of the manifold with those of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Recall that a Hausdorff space is one for which every pair of distinct
points there exists a corresponding pair of disjoint neighborhoods of those points. This is another standard regularity condition which
is also a topological invariant.
</br></br>
A slightly more general way of thinking about manifolds is to consider them as topological spaces endowed with some additional structure
which varies based on the specific type of manifold under consideration. We can denote this as a pair $(T, S)$ where $T$ is the space
and $S$ is the structure. For example, we can specify the smooth $n$-dimensional real manifold as the pair $(\mathbb{R}^n, C^\infty)$.
When viewed in this light, any map from one manifold to a counterpart which "satisfies" the underlying structure of the two spaces is
called a <i>morphism</i>. We can further refine this set by considering only those morphisms whose inverses are themselves morphisms.
A map satisfying this additional condition is called an <i>isomorphism</i>. As an example, for standard manifolds the canonical 
isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms. For smooth manifolds, the isomorphisms are diffeomorphisms. To formalize this, we define the 
following.
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition</b></u> Suppose $X$ is a topological structure. We say that the function $F_X$ is a <i>functional structure</i> on $X$
 if and only if for all open $U \subset X$
i</br></br>
1. $F_X(U)$ is a subalgebra of the algebra of all continuous real-valued functions on $U$.</br>
2. $F_X(U)$ contains all constant functions.</br>
3. $V \subset U, f \in F_X(U) \implies f|_V \in F_X(V)$</br>
4. $U = \bigcup U_\alpha$ and $f|_{U_\alpha} \in F_X(U_\alpha)$ for all $\alpha \implies f \in F_X(U)$.
</br></br>
Then the notions of morphism and isomorphism can be formulated accordingly as...
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition</b></u> A <i>morphism</i> of functionally structure spaces
$$X, F_X) \to (Y, F_Y)$$
is a map $\phi:X \to Y$ such that composition $f \to f \circ \phi$ charries $F_Y(U)$ into $F_X(\phi^{-1}(U))$. An isomorphism is a morphism $\phi$ such that $\phi^{-1}$ exists as a morphism.
</br></br>
<h2>Tangent Spaces, Differentials, and All Things Adjacent</h2>
The fundamental concept of differential calculus is the derivative, which allows us to compute the line tangent to a curve at any
given point. The analogue for manifolds is the differential, which allows us to define tangent vectors to arbitrary trajectories
along a surface. It will turn out that the set of these vectors in fact comprises a vector space
</br></br>
<u><b>Definition</b></u> Take a smooth manifold $M$ and a smooth, parametrized curve $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to M$ satisfying
$\gamma(0) = p$. Let $f$ be a smooth function defined on an open neighborhood of $p$. Then we define the <i>directional derivative</i>
of $f$ along $\gamma$ at $p$ to be
$$D_\gamma(f) = \frac{d}{dt} f(\gamma(t))|_{t=0}$$
We call the operator $D_\gamma$ the <i>tangent vector</i> to $\gamma$ at $p$.
