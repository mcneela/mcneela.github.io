Creating categories in Jekyll is simple. Just specify the category you want to
file your post under inside your post's YAML front matter, and Jekyll will take
care of the rest. <!--more--> For example, if I'm writing a post about hamsters, and I want
to create a special category for posts about my furry little friends, I would
insert the following lines at the top of the file for each post in the category:


	---
	title: <Post's title here>
	author: <Your name here>
	category: hamsters
	---


That's it! It doesn't get any easier than that.
