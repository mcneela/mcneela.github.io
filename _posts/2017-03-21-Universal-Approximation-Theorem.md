<h1 align="center">The Universal Approximation Theorem for Neural Networks</h1> 
In 1989, Hornik, Stinchombe, and White published a proof of the fact that for any continuous function $$f$$ 
on a compact set $$K$$, there exists a feedforward neural network, having only a single hidden layer, which
uniformly approximates $$f$$ within $$\varepsilon > 0$$ on $$K$$.
