<h1>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer specializing in data science and machine learning. In May 2017, I will graduate from the University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics.
 A complete listing of my current and completed coursework can be found in my <a href="resume/website_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I am interested in a wide spectrum of topics from a diverse set of fields including 
 statistics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and linguistics. I regularly blog about interesting topics in both 
 <a href="math.html">mathematics</a> and <a href="compsci.html">computer science</a>, and you can view my coding portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy writing creative fiction and reading great books. The <!--<a href="literature.html">literature</a>--> literature page (coming soon!) hosts an application that pulls from my Goodreads feed and continuously aggregates the novels that I am in the process of reading. I also enjoy running, biking, playing guitar/piano, and writing music.
