<h1>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>I am an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Computer Science. A complete listing of my current and completed coursework can be found in my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>. I am interested in a wide spectrum of topics from a diverse set of fields including mathematical analysis, topology, abstract and linear algebra, logic, numerical analysis, statistics, computability theory, computational neuroscience, machine learning, natural language processing, computational linguistics, computer vision, and computer graphics. I regularly blog about interesting topics in both <a href="math.html">mathematics</a> and <a href="compsci.html">computer science</a>, and you can view my coding portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy writing creative fiction and reading great books. The <!--<a href="literature.html">literature</a>--> literature page (coming soon!) hosts an application that pulls from my Goodreads feed and continuously aggregates the novels that I am in the process of reading.
